    "content": "STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS India and Bangladesh have a common land boundary of approximately 4096.7 kms. The India-East Pakistan land boundary was determined as per the Radcliffe Award of 1947.Disputes arose out of some provisions in the Radcliffe award, which were sought to beresolved through the Bagge Award of 1950. Another effort was made to settle these disputesby the Nehru-Noon Agreement of 1958. However, the issue relating to division of BerubariUnion was challenged before the Hon'ble Supreme Court. To comply with the opinion renderedby the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, the Constitution (Ninth Amendment) Act, 1960 waspassed by the Parliament. Due to the continuous litigation and other political developmentsat that time, the Constitution (Ninth Amendment) Act, 1960 could not be notified in respect of territories in former East Pakistan (presently Bangladesh). 2. On 16th May, 1974, the Agreement between India and Bangladesh concerning the demarcation of the land boundary and related matters was signed between both thecountries to find a solution to the complex nature of the border demarcation involved. ThisAgreement was not ratified as it involved, inter alia, transfer of territory which requires a Constitutional Amendment. In this connection, it was also required to identify the precisearea on the ground which would be transferred. Subsequently, the issues relating todemarcation of un-demarcated boundary; the territories in adverse possession; and exchangeof enclaves were identified and resolved by signing a Protocol on 6th September, 2011, which forms an integral part of the Land Boundary Agreement between India and Bangladesh,1974. The Protocol was prepared with support and concurrence of the concerned StateGovernments of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and West Bengal. 3. Accordingly, the Constitution (One Hundred and Ninteenth Amendment) Bill, 2013 which proposes to amend the First Schedule of the Constitution, for the purpose of givingeffect to the acquiring of territories by India and transfer of territories to Bangladesh throughretaining of adverse possession and exchange of enclaves, in pursuance of the aforesaidAgreement of 1974 and its Protocol entered between the Governments of India andBangladesh. 4. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objects. N EW DELHI; SALMAN KHURSHID. The 26th February , 2013. 15",

The Ad-hoc Judges and retired Judges for the Supreme Court are appointedunder clause (1) of article 127 and article 128 of the Constitution respectively. The appointment of Additional Judges and Acting Judges for the High Court is made under article 224 and theappointment of retired Judges for sittings of the High Courts is made under article 224A ofthe Constitution. The transfer of Judges from one High Court to another High Court is madeby the President after consultation with the Chief Justice of India under clause (1) of article222 of the Constitution. 2. The Supreme Court in the matter of the Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association Vs. Union of India in the year 1993, and in its Advisory Opinion in the year 1998in the Third Judges case, had interpreted clause (2) of article 124 and clause (1) of article 217of the Constitution with respect to the meaning of “consultation” as “concurrence”.Consequently, a Memorandum of Procedure for appointment of Judges to the SupremeCourt and High Courts was formulated, and is being followed for appointment. 3. After review of the relevant constitutional provisions, the pronouncements of the Supreme Court and consultations with eminent Jurists, it is felt that a broad based NationalJudicial Appointments Commission should be established for making recommendations forappointment of Judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts. The said Commission wouldprovide a meaningful role to the judiciary, the executive and eminent persons to present theirview points and make the participants accountable, while also introducing transparency inthe selection process. 4. The Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-first Amendment) Bill, 2014 is an enabling constitutional amendment for amending relevant provisions of the Constitution and forsetting up a National Judicial Appointments Commission. The proposed Bill seeks to insertnew articles 124A, 124B and 124C after article 124 of the Constitution. The said Bill alsoprovides for the composition and the functions of the proposed National JudicialAppointments Commission. Further, it provides that Parliament may, by law, regulate theprocedure for appointment of Judges and empower the National Judicial AppointmentsCommission to lay down procedure by regulation for the discharge of its functions, mannerof selection of persons for appointment and such other matters as may be considerednecessary. 5. The proposed Bill seeks to broad base the method of appointment of Judges in the Supreme Court and High Courts, enables participation of judiciary, executive and eminentpersons and ensures greater transparency, accountability and objectivity in the appointmentof the Judges in the Supreme Court and High Courts. 6. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objectives. N EW DELHI; RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD.

Recent decisions of the Supreme Court have given a very wide meaning to clauses (1) and (2) of article 31. Despite the difference in the wording of the two clauses, they are regarded as dealing with the same subject. The deprivation of property referred to in clause (1) is to be construed in the widest sense as including any curtailment of a right to property. Even where it is caused by a purely regulatory provision of law and is not accompanied by an acquisition or taking possession of that or any other property right by the State, the law, in order to be valid according to these decisions, has to provide for compensation under clause (2) of the article. It is considered necessary, therefore, to re-state more precisely the State's power of compulsory acquisition and requisitioning of private pro perty and distinguish it from cases where the operation of regulatory or prohibitory laws of the State results in \"deprivation of property\". This is sought to be done in clause 2 of the Bill. 3. It will be recalled that the zamindari abolition law s which came first in our programme of social welfare legislation were attacked by the interests affected mainly with reference to articles 14, 19 and 31, and that in order to put an end to the dilatory and wasteful litigation and place these laws above challenge in the courts, articles 31A and 31B and the Ninth Schedule were enacted by the Constitution (First Amendment) Act. Subsequent judicial decisions interpreting articles 14, 19 and 31 have raised serious difficulti es in the way of the Union and the States putting through other and equally important social welfare legislation on the desired lines, e.g., the following: - (i) While the abolition of zamindaris and the numerous intermediaries between the Stat e and the tiller of the soil has been achieved for the most part, our next objectives in land reform are the fixing of limits to the extent of agricultural land that may be owned or occupied by any person, the disposal of any land held in excess of the prescribed maximum and the further modification of the rights of land owners and tenants in agricultural holdings. (ii) The proper planning of urban and rural areas require the beneficial utilisation of vacant and waste lands and the clearanc e of slum areas. (iii) In the interest of national economy the State should have full control over the mineral and oil resources of the country, including in particular, the power to cancel or modify the terms and conditions of prospecting licenses, mining leases and similar agreements. This is also necessary in relation to public utility undertakings which supply power, light or water to the public under licenses granted by the State. (iv) It is often necessary to take over under State man agement for a temporary period a commercial or industrial undertaking or other property in the public interest or in order to secure the better management of the undertaking or property. Laws providing for such temporary transference to State management should be permissible under the Constitution. (v) The reforms in company law now under contemplation, like the progressive elimination of the managing agency system, provision for the compulsory amalgamation of two or more compa nies in the national interest, the transfer of an undertaking from one company to another, etc., require to be placed above challenge. It is accordingly proposed in clause 3 of the Bill to extend the scope of article 31A so as to cover these categorie s of essential welfare legislation. 4. As a corollary to the proposed amendment of article 31A, it is propsed in clause 5 of the Bill to include in the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution two more State Acts and four Central Acts which fall withi n the scope of sub -clauses (d) and (f) of clause (1) of the revised article 31A. The effect will be their complete, retrospective validation under the provisions of article 31B. 5. A recent judgment of the Supreme Court in Saghir Ahmed v. the State of U.P. has raised the question whether an Act providing for a State monopoly in a particular trade or business conflicts with the freedom of trade and commerce guaranteed by article 301, but left the question undecided. Clause (6) of art icle 19 was amended by the Constitution (First Amendment) Act in order to take such State monopolies out of the purview of sub -clause (g) of clause (1) of that article, but no corresponding provision was made in Part XIII of the Constitutio n with reference to the opening words of article 301. It apears from the judgment of the Supreme Court that notwithstanding the clea",

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS The Tenth Finance Commission had submitted its report on the 26th November, 1994 for the period of five years, i.e.,from 1995 -96 to 1999 -2000. The said report was laid on the table of both the Houses o f Parliament on the 14th March,1995. One of the recommendations of the Commission that has been under consideration of the Government is an alternative scheme of sharing of the proceeds of certain Union taxes and duties between the Union and the States. 2. The alternative scheme envisages that twenty -six per cent out of the gross proceeds of Union taxes and duties (excluding stamp duty, excise duty on medicinal toilet preparations, Central Sales Tax,Consignment tax, cesses levied for specific purposes under any law made by Parliament and Surcharge) is to be assigned to the States in lieu of their existing share in income -tax, basic excise duties, special excise duties and grants in lieu of tax on railway passenger fares. 3. In addition, three per cent share in the gross proceeds of all Central taxes and duties (excluding stamp duty, excise duty on medicinal/toilet preparations, Central Sales Tax, Consignment tax, cesses levied for specific purpose under any law made by Parliament and Surcharge) is to be assig ned to the States in lieu of their existing share in Additional Excise Duties in lieu of Sales Tax on tobacco, cotton and sugar. The commission had proposed that tobacco, cotton and sugar may continue to be exempt from Sales Tax and the Additional Excise Duties in lieu of Sales Tax on these items may be merged with the Basic Excise Duties. 4. Whether the alternative scheme would be more gainful to the Centre or to the States vis -à- vis existing arrangements would entirely depend on the relative growth in the Collection of various Central taxes and duties to be pooled. 5. The benefits of the scheme have been listed by the Commission in para 13.2. and 13.3 and 13.18 of their reports. These areas follows: - (i) with a given share being allotted to the States in t he aggregate revenues from Central taxes, the States will be able to share the aggregate buoyancy of Central taxes; (ii) the Central Government can pursue tax reforms without the need to consider whether a tax is sharable in the states or not; (iii) the im pact of fluctuations in Central tax revenues would be felt alike by the Central and the State Governments; (iv) Should the taxes mentioned in articles 268 and/or 269 from part of this arrangement, there will be greater likelihood of their being tapped; and (v) the progress of reforms will be greatly facilitated if the ambit of tax sharing arrangement is enlarged so as to give greater certainty of resource flows to, and increased flexibility in tax reform. 6. The above scheme recommended by the Commission is in national interest as it helps to remove a perceived inter -tax in the tax mobilisation effort of the Government of India while leaving sufficient flexibility for meeting Centre’s exclusive needs by keeping Cesses and Surcharges outside the pooling arran gement. 7. A Discussion Paper bringing out various aspects of the scheme was laid on the table of both the Houses of Parliament on the 20th December, 1996 with a view to generate an informed debate. 8. On the basis of a consensus reached in the Third Meeting of the inter -State Council held on the 17th July, 1997, the then Government had agreed in principle to accept the scheme recommended by the Tenth Finance Commission subject to certain modifications. 9. The Government had decided to ratify the decis ion taken by the previous Government according in principle approval for the scheme recommended by the Tenth Finance Commission with some modifications. 10. Firstly, the percentage share of State is to be reviewed by the successive Finance Commissions inst ead of freezing it for fifteen years as suggested by the Tenth Finance Commission. 11. Secondly, Government had decided to change the sharing of “gross proceeds” as recommended by the Tenth Finance Commission to the sharing of “net proceeds” in order to maintain consistency between articles 270, 279 and 280 of the Constitution. However, this will not result in any consequent loss to the States because the Government has also simultaneously decided to compensate the States by suitably enhancing the percentag e share beyond 29%. 12. Thirdly, as intended by the Commission, no amendment is sought to be done in article 271, which authorize the Central Government to levy surcharge on Central taxes and duties for the purpose of the Union. 13. The scheme will be effe ctive from 1st April, 1996. The percentage share of net proceeds during 1996 -97 to 1999 -2000 will be such that the States’ share is",

(2) The proceeds in any financial year of any such tax levied in accordance with the provisions of clause (1) shall be - (a) collected by the Government of India and the States; (b) appropriated by the Government of India and the States, in accordance with such principles of collection and appropriation as may be formulated by Parliament by law.\". 3.Amendment of article 270. - In article 270 of the Constitution, in clause (1), for the words and fi gures \"articles 268 and 269\", the words, figures and letter \"articles 268, 268A and 269\" shall be substituted. 4.Amendment of Seventh Schedule. - In the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, in List I-Union List, after entry 92B, the following entry shall be inserted, namely: - \"92C. Taxes on services.\". T.K. VISWANATHAN, Secy. to the Govt. of India. STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS At present, the item relating to \"taxes on services\" is not specifical ly mentioned in any entry either in the Union List or in the State List of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution. Parliament has the exclusive power to make laws with respect to entry 97 of the Union List for any other matters not enumerated in List Il or List III including any tax not mentioned in either of those Lists. In exercise of this power, the Central Government has periodically taxes certain services at the rate of five per cent. ad valorem. 2. The States have taken a unanimous decision to repla ce their existing sales tax system with the system of Value Added Tax (VAT) from the 1st April, 2003. In this context, with a view to widening their tax base, the States have suggested that they should be enabled to collect and appropriate tax on services. 3. The \"service\" sector accounted for 48.5% of the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the financial year 2000 -2001. The role of this sector in the economy is quite significant. Expert Committees set up by the Central Government have repeatedly reco mmended taxation of services. On the basis of the deliberations between the State Governments and the Central Government and in view of the recommendations of various Expert Committees, it is proposed to suitably amend the Constitution to provide, (i) tax on services as a specific entry in the Union List, (ii) insertion of a new article, namely, article 268A and (iii) consequential amendment to article 270, to enable Parliament to formulate by law principles for determining the modalities of levying the sai d tax by the Central Government and collection of the proceeds thereof by the Central Government and the States. 4. The proposed amendment would help in significant augmentation of revenues of the States in accordance with the proposed law, and pave the wa y for eventual inclusion of services within the purview of State level VAT. 5. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objects. JASWANT SINGH. New Delhi: The 11th February, 2003.",

BE it enacted by Parliament in the Fifty -second Year of the Republic of India as follows: - 1.Short title and commencement. -(1) This Act may be called the Constitution (Eighty -fifth Amendment) Act, 2001. (2) It shall be deemed to have come into force on the 17th day of June, 1995. 2.Amendment of article 16. -In article 16 of the Constitution, in clause (4A), for the words \"in matters of promotion to any class\", the words \"in matters of promotion, with consequential seniority, to any class\" shall be substituted. SUBHASH C. JAIN, Secy.to the Govt. of India. STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS The Government servants belonging to the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes had been enjoying the benefit of consequential seniority on their promotion on the basis of rule of reservation. The judgments of the Supreme Court in the case o f Virpal Singh Chauhan (1995) 6 SCC 684 andAjit Singh No. I AIR 1996 SC 1189, which led to the issue of the O.M. dated 30th January, 1997, have adversely affected the interest of the Government servants belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribe s category in the matter of seniority on promotion to the next higher grade. This has led to considerable anxiety and representations have also been received from various quarters including Members of Parliament to protect the interest of the Government se rvants belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. 2. The Government has reviewed the position in the light of views received from various quarters and in order to protect the interest of the Government servants belonging to the Scheduled Castes an d Scheduled Tribes, it has been decided to negate the effect of O,M. dated 30th January, 1997 immediately. Mere withdrawal of the O.M dated 30th January, 1997 will not meet the desired purpose and review or revision of seniority of the Government servants and grant of consequential benefits to such Government servants will also be necessary. This will require amendment to article 16(4A) of the Constitution to provide for consequential seniority in the case of promotion by virtue of rule of reservation. It i s also necessary to give retrospective effect to the proposed constitutional amendment to article 16(4A) with effect from the date of coming into force of article 16(4A) itself, that is, from the 17th day of June, 1995. 3.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS Prior to August, 29, 1997, the vacancies reserved for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, which could not be filled up by direct recruitment on account of non -availability of t he candidates belonging to the Scheduled Castes or the Scheduled Tribes, were treated as \"Backlog Vacancies\". These vacancies were treated as a distinct group and were excluded from the ceiling of fifty per cent reservation. The Supreme Court of India in i ts judgment in the Indra Sawhney versus Union of India held that the number of vacancies to be filled up on the basis of reservations in a year including carried forward reservations should in no case exceed the limit of fifty per cent. As total reservatio ns in a year for the Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes and the other Backward Classes combined together had already reached forty -nine and a half per cent and the total number of vacancies to be filled up in a year could not exceed fifty per cent., it became difficult to fill the \"Backlog Vacancies\" and to hold Special Recruitment Drives. Therefore, to implement the judgment of the Supreme Court, an Official Memorandum dated August 29, 1997 was issued to provide that the fifty per cent limit shall appl y to current as well as \"Backlog Vacancies\" and for discontinuation of the Special Recruitment Drive. 2. Due to the adverse effect of the aforesaid order dated August 29, 1997, various organisations including the Members of Parliament represented to the ce ntral Government for protecting the interest of the Scheduled castes and the Scheduled Tribes. The Government, after considering various representations, reviewed the position and has decided to make amendment in the constitution so that the unfilled vacan cies of a year, which are reserved for being filled up in that year in accordance with any provision for reservation made under clause (4) or clause (4A) of article 16 of the Constitution, shall be considered as a separate class of vacancies to be filled up in any succeeding year or years and such class of vacancies shall not be considered together with the vacancies of the year in which they are being filled up for determining the ceiling of fifty percent. Reservation on total number of vacancies of that y ear. This amendment in the Constitution would enable the State to restore the position as was prevalent before august 29, 1997. 3.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS 1. Provisos to articles 82 and 170 (3) of the Constitution provide that no fresh readjustment of constituencies can be undertaken until the figures of the first census taken after the year 2000 are published. These provisos were inserted by the Constitution (Forty -second Amendment) Act, 1976 as a measure to boost family planning norms. Since the first census to be taken after the year 2000 has already begun, the constitutional embargo on undertaking fresh delimitation will lapse as soon as the figures of this census are published. 2. There have been consistent demands, both for and against undertaking the exercise of fresh delimitation. Keeping in view the progress of family planning programmes in different parts of the country, the Government, as part of the National Population Policy strategy, recently decided to extend the current freeze on undertaking fresh delimitation up to the year 2026 as a motivational measure to enable the State Government to pursue the agenda for population stabilisation. 3. Government has also decide d to undertake readjustment and rationalization of territorial constituencies in the States, without altering the number of seats allotted to each State in the House of the People and Legislative Assemblies of the States, including the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes constituencies, on the basis of the population ascertained at the census for the year 1991, so as to remove the imbalance caused due to uneven growth of population/electorate in different constituencies. 4. It is also proposed to refix the number of seats reserved for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes in the House of the People and the Legislative Assemblies of the States on the basis of the population ascertained at the census for the year 1991.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS Pursuant to enactment of the Constitution (Eighty -fourth Amendment) Act, 2001, the Delimitation Act, 2002 was enacted to constitute the Delimitation Commission for giving effect to the purposes of the aforesaid constitutional amendment. The Delimitation Co mmission has accordingly been constituted on 12.7.2002 with Shri Justice Kuldip Singh, a retired Judge of the Supreme Court as its Chairperson and Shri B.B. Tandon, Election Commissioner in the Election Commission of India, and the concerned State Election Commissioners as its ex officio members. The main task of the Commission is to readjust the territorial constituencies in the House of the People with regard js the seats allocated to each State and the readjustment of territorial constituencies of the Le gislative Assembly of each State. The rationalisation of the constituencies as now provided is on the basis of the 1991, census figures. The Commission is entrusted with the function of also refixing the number of seats reserved for the Scheduled Castes an d the Scheduled Tribes on the basis of census of 1991. The Commission has started functioning with the secretarial assistance from the Election Commission of India and is expected to complete its work within two years. 2 The Delimitation Commission in its letter to the Government had stated that in the light of views expressed by various intellectuals including lawyers, political thinkers and other experts, the delimitation, which was being done after a gap of thirty years should not be done on the basis of the out -dated figures of 1991 census . 3. An all -party meeting was held on 13.3.2003 on the functioning of the Delimitation Commission in which many political parties expressed the view that the delimitation of Parliamentary and Assembly constituencies sh ould be done on the basis of 200 I census. It was, therefore, decided in the said meeting that if any political party had any suggestion with regard t~ alteration of the applicable census from 1991 to the year 2001, it might send the same in writing to the Minister of Law and Justice. Some major political parties which have responded are in favour of200 I census being the basis of delimitation. 4. Accordingly., it has been decided to provide for readjustment of electoral constituencies, including those rese rved for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, based on the population census for -the year 200 I, without affecting the number of seats allocated to States in the legislative bodies. 5. The Bill seeks to achieve the objects mentioned above. ARUN J AITLEY. NEW DELHI; The 25th April. 2003.",

SUBHASH C. JAIN, Secy.to the Govt. of India. STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS The Constitution of India in a Directive Principle contained in article 45, has 'made a provision for free and compulsory education for all children up to the age of f ourteen years within ten years of promulgation of the Constitution. We could not achieve this goal even after 50 years of adoption of this provision. The task of providing education to all children in this age group gained momentum after the National Polic y of Education (NPE) was announced in 1986. The Government of India, in partnership with the State Governments, has made strenuous efforts to fulfil this mandate and, though significant improvements were seen in various educational indicators, the ultimate goal of providing universal and quality education still remains unfulfilled. In order to fulfil this goal, it is felt that an explicit provision should be made in the Part relating to Fundamental Rights of the Constitution. 2. With a view to making right to free and compulsory education a fundamental right, the Constitution (Eighty -third Amendment) Bill, 1997 was introduced in Parliament to insert a new article, namely, article 21 A conferring on all children in the age group of 6 to 14 years the right to free and compulsory education. The said Bill was scrutinised by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Human Resource Development and the subject was also dealt with in its 165th Report by the Law Commission of India. 3. After taking into consideration th e report of the Law Commission of India and the recommendations of the Standing Committee of Parliament, the proposed amendments in Part III, Part IV and Part IVA of the Constitution are being made which are as follows: - (a) to provide for free and compuls ory education to children in the age group of 6 to 14 years and for this purpose, a legislation would be introduced in Parliament after the Constitution (Ninety -third Amendment) Bill, 200l is enacted; (b) to provide in article 45 of the Constitution that the State shall endeavour to provide early childhood care and education to children below the age of six years; and (c) to amend article 5lA of the Constitution with a view to providing that it shall be the obligation of the parents to pr ovide opportunities for education to their children. 3. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objects. MURLI MANOHAR JOSHI. NEWDELHI; The 16th November, 2001.",

The said Act provided that within one year from date of commencement of that Act, all the States shall amend their local laws to bring them in conformity with the new provisions under the Constitution. This exercise will required to be completed before the 23rd April, 1994. 2. Article 243D provides for reservation for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes in every Pa nchayat. Arunachal Pradesh is a State inhabited fully by indigenous tribal people. No Scheduled Castes exist in the State. No reservation of seats for the Scheduled Castes has been made in the State Legislative Assembly and no provisions exist under any la w to that effect. There is also no reservation for the Scheduled Castes in State Government services. 3. The Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation, 1873 and the Chin Hill Regulations, 1896 provide special protection and safeguard for the peaceful existence of the indigenous tirbal people of Arunachal Pradesh. These laws probihit the entry of outsiders in the tribal area without \"Inner Line Permit\". Only the indigenous tribal people are allowed to participate in the democratic process. 4. The tribal society in Arunachal Pradesh is, casteless where social equality among men and women has prevailed over centuries and ages. Since no Scheduled Castes exist in the State and the State of Arunachal Pradesh is singularly free from the caste system, it is proposed to ins ert a new clause (3A) in article 243M of the Constitution of India, to exempt the State of Arunachal Pradesh from the application of article 243D relating to the reservation of seats in Panchayats for the Scheduled Castes. 5. This will provide a legal and constitutional basis for Panchayat Raj Institutions in Arunachal Pradesh in accordance with the socio -political ethos of the State. 6. The Bill seeks to achieve the aforesaid objective.

The requirement that members of the two Houses should assemble at a jo int sitting for the election of the Vice -President seems to be totally unnecessary and may also cause practical difficulties. It is, therefore, proposed to amend this article to provide that the Vice -President will be elected by members of an electoral col lege consisting of members of both Houses of Parliament. Under article 54 of the Constitution, the President is elected by an electoral college consisting of the elected members of both Houses of Parliament and of the Legislative Assemblies of the States. Every effort is made to complete such elections before the date of the Presidential election. It is, however, possible that the elections to the two Houses of Parliament may not be completed before the President or the Vice -President is elected. It is, the refore, proposed to amend article 71 of the Constitution so as to make it clear that the election of the President or the Vice -President cannot be challenged on the ground of any vacancy for any reason in the appropriate electoral college. 2.

These salaries have remained static since 1950, despite high inflation and price rise that has taken place during all these years. The Joint Conference of Chief Justices, Chief Ministers and Law Ministers of the States held on 31st August and 1st September, 1985, inter alia, discussed and recommended improvement in service conditions of Judges including increase in their salaries, not only to minimise the inflationary pressures on them but also to attract best talents in the country to man the judicial posts. 3. Having considered all aspects of the matter, it is proposed to increase th e salaries of the Judges as detailed below: Chief Justice of India Rs. 10,000 per month Judges of the Supreme Court Rs. 9,000 per month Chief Justice of a High Court Rs. 9,000 per month Judges of a High Court Rs. 8,000 per month 4.

The one -year period in the case of the Proclamation made with respect to the State of Punjab is due to expire on the 10th May, 1988. In vi ew of the continued disturbed situation in Punjab, escalation in the activities of terrorists and anti -national forces resulting in the death of innocent men, women and children and of the fact that the Punjab State Legislative Assembly had to be dissolved because of the virtual impossibility of forming a popular Government in the prevailing circumstances, the continuance in force of the said Proclamation beyond the period of one year may be necessary in Punjab. Article 356(5) of the Constitution is, theref ore, proposed to be amended so as to facilitate the extension of the said Proclamation, if necessary up to a period of three years as permissible under clause (4) of that article. The continuance of the Proclamation after the 10th May, 1988 may not, it is felt, be effective as terrorist activities had been on the increase. It may be necessary to invoke the provisions of article 352 of the Constitution to declare a partial Emergence either in the whole of the State of Punjab or in particular districts of tha t State. If such a situation arises, the expression \"armed rebellion\" included in that article as one of the grounds for declaration of Emergency (which alone could be resorted to in the case of an Internal Emergency) may not be appropriate in the prevaili ng situation in Punjab to declare a Proclamation in that State. It is, therefor, felt that article 352 may be suitably amended in its application to the State of Punjab to include \"internal disturbance\" as one of the grounds that the integrity of India is threatened by internal disturbance in any part of the territory of India so as to facilitate the taking of action under that article if it becomes necessary at a future date. The expression \"internal disturbance\" was one of the grounds included in that art icle from the commencement of the Constitution till it was amended by the Constitution (Forty -fourth Amendment) Act, 1978. Consequentially, articles 358 and 359 are also proposed to be amended so as to provide for the automatic suspension of article 19 of the Constitution and the issuing of an order by the President suspending the operation of any of the other provisions contained in Part III (except article 20) under article 359, if and when a Proclamation of Emergency on the ground of internal disturbance is issued in relation to the whole or any part of the State of Punjab. As the proposed amendments are only for the purpose of curbing the terrorist activities in the State of Punjab more effectively, the powers that are proposed to be conferred by these a mendments would not be resorted to for any period beyond what is absolutely necessary for achieving the aforesaid object. Accordingly, the amendments proposed in articles 352, 358 and 359 have been made to be operative only for a period of two years from t he commencement of this Amendment. The Bill seeks to achieve the aforesaid objects. NEW DELHI; BUTA SINGH. The 11th March, 1988.

If it is not combated, it is likely to undermine the very foundations of our democracy and the principl es which sustain it. With this object, an assurance was given in the Address by the President to Parliament that the Government intended to introduce in the current session of Parliament an anti -defection Bill. This Bill is meant for outlawing defection an d fulfilling the above assurance. 2. The Bill seeks to amend the Constitution to provide that an elected member of Parliament or a State Legislature, who has been elected as a candidate set up by a political party and a nominated member of Parliament or a State Legislature who is a member of a political party at the time he takes his seat or who becomes a member of a political party within six months after he takes his seat would be disqualified on the ground of defection if he voluntarily relinquishes his membership of such political party or votes or abstains from voting in such House contrary to any direction of such party or is expelled from such party. An independent member of Parliament or a State Legislature shall also be disqualified if he joins any political party after his election. A nominated member of Parliament or a State Legislature who is not a member of a political party at the time of his nomination and who has not become a member of any political party before the expiry of six months from t he date on which he takes his seat shall be disqualified if he joins any political party after the expiry of the said period of six months. The Bill also makes suitable provisions with respect to splits in, and mergers of, political parties. A special prov ision has been included in the Bill to enable a person who has been elected as the presiding officer of a House to sever his connections with his political party. The question as to whether a member of a House of Parliament or State Legislature has become subject to the proposed disqualification will be determined by the presiding officer of the House; where the question is with reference to the presiding officer himself, it will be decided by a member of the House elected by the House in that behalf. 3.

Even though these States are predominantly tribal areas, the underlying objective of the aforesaid Act was to ensure that the members of the Scheduled Tribes in these areas do not fair to secure a minimal representation because of their inability to complete with the advanced sections of the people. 2. The Constitution (Fifty -first Amendm ent) Act, though formally enforced, cannot be fully implemented unless parallel action is taken to determine the seats which are to be reserved for Scheduled Tribes in these areas. The number of seats reserved for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in t he Legislative Assembly of any State under article 332 of the Constitution will have to be determined having regard to the provisions of article 332(3) of the Constitution. However, in view of the historical background with respect to the areas comprised i n the North -Eastern States, the circumstances obtaining in these areas in the state of development of the Scheduled Tribes in these areas and other relevant considerations, it is considered necessary to provide for special arrangements with regard to the r eservation for Scheduled Tribes in these areas for a temporary period so as to facilitate easy transition of these areas to the normal arrangements as envisaged in the Constitution. It is, therefore, proposed to further amend article 332 of the Constitutio n for making a temporary provision, until the re -adjustment of seats on the basis of the first census after the year 2000 under article 170 of the Constitution for these States, for the determination of the number of seats reserved for Scheduled Tribes. 3. The proposed amendment seeks to provide that if all the seats in the Legislative Assembly of such States in existence on the date of coming into force of this Constitution Amendment Act are held by the members of the Scheduled Tribes, all the seats except one shall be reserved for Scheduled Tribes and in any other case such number of seats as bears to the total number of seats a proportion not less than the number of members belonging to the Scheduled Tribes in the existing Assembly bears to the total numb er of seats in the existing Assembly. 4.

The citizen's right to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by article 19(1)(a) has been held by some courts to be so comprehensive as not to render a person culpable even if he advocates murder and other crimes of violence. In other coun tries with written constitutions, freedom of speech and of the press is not regarded as debarring the State from punishing or preventing abuse of this freedom. The citizen's right to practise any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or business conferred by article 19(1)(g) is subject to reasonable restrictions which the laws of the State may impose \"in the interests of general public\". While the words cited are comprehensive enough to cover any scheme of nationalisation which the State may under take, it is desirable to place the matter beyond doubt by a clarificatory addition to article 19(6). Another article in regard to which unanticipated difficulties have arisen is article 31. The validity of agrarian reform measures passed by the State Legis latures in the last three years has, in spite of the provisions of clauses (4) and (6) of article 31, formed the subject -matter of dilatory litigation, as a result of which the implementation of these important measures, affecting large numbers of people, has been held up. The main objects of this Bill are, accordingly to amend article 19 for the purposes indicated above and to insert provisions fully securing the constitutional validity of zamindari abolition laws in general and certain specified State Ac ts in particular. the opportunity has been taken to propose a few minor amendments to other articles in order to remove difficulties that may arise. It is laid down in article 46 as a directive principle of State policy that the State should promote with special care the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of the people and protect them from social injustice. In order that any special provision that the State may make for the educational, economic or social advancement of any backward class of citizens may not be challenged on the ground of being discriminatory, it is proposed that article 15(3) should be suitably amplified. Certain amendments in respect of articles dealing with the convening and proroguing of the sessions of Parliamen t have been found necessary and are also incorporated in this Bill. So also a few minor amendments in respect of articles 341, 342, 372 and 376. New Delhi; JAWAHARLAL NEHRU. The 10th May, 1951. THE CONSTITUTION (FIRST AMENDMENT) ACT, 1951 [18th June,195 1.] An Act to amend the Constitution of India. BE it enacted by Parliament as follows: - 1.

India has sovereign rights over the resources of the exclusive economic zone and is entitled to exercise jurisdiction in respect of certain other matters. It is proposed to amend article 297 of the Constitution so as to provide that all lands, minerals and other things of value underlying the ocean within the exclusive economic zone of India and all other resources of the exclusive economic zone of India shall also vest in the Union and be held for the purposes of the Union. At p resent, the limits of territorial waters and the continental shelf are determined by Proclamation issued by the President. It is proposed that the limits of the territorial waters, the continental shelf, the exclusive economic zone and the maritime zones o f India shall be as specified from time to time by or under law made by Parliament. 2. Recourse was had in the past to the Ninth Schedule whenever it was found that progressive legislation conceived in the interest of the public was imperilled by litigatio n. Certain State legislations relating to land reforms and ceiling on agricultural land holdings have already been included in the Ninth Schedule. Certain amendments made to these legislations also require protection of the provisions of article 31B inasmu ch as in many cases such enactments have been challenged in courts and courts have granted interim reliefs which has hampered the implementation of the national land reform policy. 3. Besides these Acts relating to land reforms certain State enactments rel ating to private forests require protection of article 31B as these enactments are progressive and beneficial pieces of legislation intended to and the monopoly of vested interests and forest contractors. Some of such legislations have been challenged in courts and as the courts have granted interim reliefs staying the operation of these enactments, the State Governments have not been able to implement these legislations. 4. Certain Central laws like the Smugglers and Foreign Exchange Manipulators (Forfeitu re of Property) Act, 1976, the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976, the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 and certain provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 require protection of article 31B. If these legislations are allowed to be challenged i n courts of law thereby delaying the implementation of these laws, the vary purpose of enacting these laws would be frustrated and the national economy may be severely affected. These and other important and special enactments which it is considered necess ary should have the constitutional protection are proposed to be included in the Ninth Schedule. 5. The Bill seeks to give effect to the above objects. NEW DELHI; H. R. GOKHALE. The 18th May, 1976.

Although the Legislative Assembly is in suspended animation and a popular government can be installed, having regard to the prevailing situation in the State, the continuance o f the Proclamation beyond 5th October, 1984 may be necessary. To facilitate the adoption of a resolution by the two Houses of Parliament approving the continuance in force of the Proclamation beyond 5th October, 1984, it is necessary to amend article 356 o f the Constitution.

    "content": "THE CONSTITUTION (FORTY -FOURTH AMENDMENT) THE CONSTITUTION (FORTY -FOURTH AMENDMENT) Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Constitution (Forty -fifth Amendment) Bill, 1978 (Bill No. 88 of 1978) which was enacted as THE CONSTITUTION (Forty -fourth Amendment) Act, 1978 STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS Recents experience has shown that the fundamental rights, including those of life and liberty, granted to citizens by the Constitution are capable of being taken away by a transient majori ty. It is, therefore, necessary to provide adequate safeguards against the recurrence of such a contingency in the future and to ensure to the people themselves an effective voice in determining the form of government under which they are to live. This is one of the primary objects of this Bill. 2. It is, therefore, proposed to provide that certain changes in the Constitution which would have the effect of impairing its secular or democratic character, abridging or taking away fundamental rights prejudicing or impeding free and fair elections on the basis of adult suffrage and compromising the independence of judiciary, can be made only if they are approved by the people of India by a majority of votes at a referendum in which at least fifty -one per cent. of the electorate participate. Article 368 is being amended to ensure this. 3. In view of the special position sought to be given to fundamental rights, the right to property, which has been the occasion for more than one amendment of the Constitution, would cease to be a fundamental right and become only a legal right. Necessary amendments for this purpose are being made to article 19 and article 31 is being deleted. It would, however, be ensured that the removal of property from the list of fundamental righ ts would not affect the right of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice. 4. Similarly, the right of persons holding land for personal cultivation and within the ceiling limit to receive compensation at the market va lue would not be affected. 5. Property, while ceasing to be a fundamental right, would, however, be given express recognition as a legal right, provision being made that no person shall be deprived of his property save in accordance with law. 6. A Proclama tion of Emergency under article 352 has virtually the effect of amending the Constitution by converting it for the duration into that of a Unitary State and enabling the rights of the citizen to move the courts for the enforcement of fundamental rights ---including the right to life and liberty ---to be suspended. Adequate safeguards are, therefore, necessary to ensure that this power is properly exercised and is not abused. It is, therefore, proposed that a Proclamation of Emergency can be issued only when t he security of India or any part of its territory is threatened by war or external aggression or by armed rebellion. Internal disturbance not amounting to armed rebellion would not be a ground for the issue of a Proclamation. 7. Further, in order to ensure that a Proclamation is issued only after due consideration, it is sought to be provided that an Emergency can be proclaimed only on the basis of written advice tendered to the President by the Cabinet. In addition, as a Proclamation of Emergency virtually has the effect of amending the Constitution, it is being provided that the Proclamation would have to be approved by the two Houses of Parliament by the same majority which is necessary to amend the Constitution and such approval would have to be given wi thin a period of one month. Any such Proclamation would be in force only for a period of six months and can be continued only by further resolutions passed by the same majority. The Proclamation would also cease to be in operation if a resolution disapprov ing the continuance of the Proclamation is passed by Lok Sabha. Ten per cent. or more of the Members of Lok Sabha can requisition a special meeting for considering a resolution for disapproving the Proclamation. 8. As a further check against the misuse of the Emergency provisions and to put the right to life and liberty on a secure footing, it would be provided that the power to suspend the right to move the court for the enforcement of a fundamental right cannot be exercised in respect of the fundamental r ight to life and liberty. The right to liberty is further strengthened by the provision that a law for preventive detention cannot authorise, in any case, detention for a longer period than two months, unless an Advisory Board has reported that there is sufficient cause for such detention. An additional safeguard would be provided by the requirement that the Chairman of an Advisory Board shall be a serving Judge of the appropriate High Court and that the Board shall be constituted in accordance with the rec ommendations of the Chief Justice of that High Court. 9. A special provision is being made guaranteeing the right of the media to repor",

    "content": "THE CONSTITUTION (FORTY -SECOND AMENDMENT) ACT, 1976 THE CONSTITUTION (FORTY -SECOND AMENDMENT) ACT, 1976 Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Constitution (Forty -fourth Amendment) Bill, 1976 (Bill No. 91 of 1976) which was enacted as THE CONSTITUTION (Forty -second Amendment) Act, 1976 STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS A Constitution to be living must be growing. If the impediments to the growth of the Constitution are not removed, the Constitution will suffer a virtual atrophy. The question of amending the Constitution for removing the difficulties which have arisen in achieving the objective of socio -economic revolution, which would end poverty and ignorance and disease and inequality of opportunity, has been engaging the active attention o f Government and the public for some years now. 2. The democratic institutions provided in the Constitution are basically sound and the path for progress does not lie in denigrating any of these institutions. However, there could be no denial that these in stitutions have been subjected to considerable stresses and strains and that vested interests have been trying to promote their selfish ends to the great detriment of public good. 3. It is, therefore, proposed to amend the Constitution to spell out express ly the high ideals of socialism, secularism and the integrity of the nation, to make the directive principles more comprehensive and give them precedence over those fundamental rights which have been allowed to be relied upon to frustrate socio -economic re forms for implementing the directive principles. It is also proposed to specify the fundamental duties of the citizens and make special provisions for dealing with anti -national activities, whether by individuals or associations. 4. Parliament and the Stat e Legislatures embody the will of the people and the essence of democracy is that the will of the people should prevail. Even though article 368 of the Constitution is clear and categoric with regard to the all inclusive nature of the amending power, it is considered necessary to put the matter beyond doubt. It is proposed to strengthen the presumption in favour of the constitutionality of legislation enacted by Parliament and State Legislatures by providing for a requirements as to the minimum number of Ju dges for determining questions as to the constitutionality of laws and for a special majority of not less than two -thirds for declaring any law to be constitutionally invalid. It is also proposed to take away the jurisdiction of High Courts with regard to determination of Constitutional validity of Central laws and confer exclusive jurisdiction in this behalf on the Supreme Court so as to avoid multiplicity of proceedings with regard to validity of the same Central law in different High Courts and the conse quent possibility of the Central law being valid in one State and invalid in another State. 5. To reduce the mounting arrears in High Courts and to secure the speedy disposal of service matters, revenue matters and certain other matters of special importan ce in the context of the socio -economic development and progress, it is considered expedient to provide for administrative and other tribunals for dealing with such matters while preserving the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in regard to such matters un der article 136 of the Constitution. It is also necessary to make certain modifications in the writ jurisdiction of the High Courts under article 226. 6. It is proposed to avail of the present opportunity to make certain other amendments which have become necessary in the light of the working of the Constitution. 7. The various amendments proposed in the Bill have been explained in the notes on clauses. 8. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objects. NEW DELHI; H. R. GOKHALE. The 28th August, 1976.

T he immunity does not extend to any amendment made to such Acts after their inclusion in the Ninth Schedule. 2. Recourse was had in the past to the Ninth Schedule whenever it was found that progressive legislation conceived in the interest of the public was imperilled by litigation. Several State enactments relating to land reforms and ceiling on agricultural land holdings have already been included in the Ninth Schedule. The Sixth Five Year Plan (1980 -85) contains an assurance that \"necessary action would b e taken to bring before Parliament land reform Acts not yet included in the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution for immediate inclusion in the said Schedule\" and that the same \"would be done in the case of future Acts without delay so that these laws are pr otected from challenge in courts\". The State Governments of Assam, Bihar, Haryana, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal and the Administration of the Union territory of Goa, Daman and Diu have suggested the inclusion of some of their Acts relating to land reforms in the Ninth Schedule. Some of the Acts suggested for inclusion are by way of amendments to Acts already included in the Ninth Schedule. The various Acts which have been suggested for inclusion have been examined and it is proposed to include in the Ninth Schedule such of these Acts as have either been challenged or are likely to be challenged and thereby ensure that the implementation of these Acts is not adversely affected by litigation. 3.

    "content": "THE CONSTITUTION (FORTY -SIXTH AMENDMENT) THE CONSTITUTION (FORTY -SIXTH AMENDMENT) Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Constitution (Forty -sixth Amendment) Bill, 1981 which was enacted as THE CONSTITUTION (Forty -sixth Amendment) Act, 1982 STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS Sales tax laws enacted in pursuance of the Government of India Act, 1935 as also the laws relating to sales tax passed after the coming into force of the Constitution proceeded on the footing that the expression \"sale of go ods\", having regard to the rule as to broad interpretation of entries in the legislative lists, would be given a wider connotation. However, in Gannon Dunkerley's case (A.I.R. 1958 S.C. 560), the Supreme Court held that the expression \"sale of goods\" as us ed in the entries in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution has the same meaning as in the Sale of Goods Act, 1930. This decision related to works contracts. 2. By a series of subsequent decisions, the Supreme Court has, on the basis of the decision in G annon Dunkerley's case, held various other transactions which resemble, in substance, transactions by way of sales, to be not liable to sales tax. As a result of these decisions, a transaction, in order to be subject to the levy of sales tax under entry 92 A of the Union List or entry 54 of the State List, should have the following ingredients, namely, parties competent to contract, mutual assent and transfer of property in goods from one of the parties to the contract to the other party thereto for a price. 3. This position has resulted in scope for avoidance of tax in various ways. An example of this is the practice of inter -State consignment transfers, i.e., transfer of goods from head office or a principal in one State to a branch or agent in another Stat e or vice versa or transfer of goods on consignment account, to avoid the payment of sales tax on inter -State sales under the Central Sales Tax Act. While in the case of a works contract, if the contract treats the sale of materials separately from the cos t of the labour, the sale of materials would be taxable, but in the case of an indivisible works contract, it is not possible to levy sales tax on the transfer of property in the goods involved in the execution of such contract as it has been held that the re is no sale of the materials as such and the property in them does not pass as moveables. Though practically the purchaser in a hire -purchase agreement gets the goods on the date of the hire -purchase, it has been held that there is sale only when the purchaser exercises the option to purchase at a much later date and therefore only the depreciated value of the goods involved in such transaction at the time the option to purchase is exercised becomes assessable to sales tax. Similarly, while sale by a regi stered club or other association of persons (the club or association of persons having corporate status) to its members is taxable, sales by an unincorporated club or association of persons to its members is not taxable as such club or association, in law, has no separate existence from that of the members. In the Associated Hotels of India case (A.I.R. 1972 S.C. 1131), the Supreme Court held that there is no sale involved in the supply of food or drink by a hotelier to a person lodged in the hotel. 4. In t he New India Sugar Mills case (A.I.R. 1963 S.C. 1207), the Supreme Court took the view that in the transfer of controlled commodities in pursuance of a direction under a Control Order, the element of volition by the seller, or mutual assent, is absent and, therefore, there is no sale as defined in the Sale of Goods Act, 1930. However, in Oil and Natural Gas Commission Vs. State of Bihar (A.I.R. 1976 S.C. 2478), the Supreme Court had occasion to consider its earlier decisions with regard to the liability of transfers of controlled commodities to be charged to sales tax. The Supreme Court held that where there are any statutory compulsions, the statute itself should be treated as supplying the consensus and furnishing the modality of the consensus. In Vishnu A gencies Vs. Commercial Tax Officer (A.I.R. 1978 S.C. 449), six of the seven Judges concurred in over-ruling the decision, in New India Sugar Mills case while the seventh Judge held the case to be distinguishable. It is, therefore, considered desirable to p ut the matter beyond any doubt. 5. The various problems connected with the power of the States to levy a tax on the sale of goods and with the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 were referred to the Law Commission of India. The Commission considered these matters in their Sixty -first Report and, recommended, inter alia, certain amendments in the Constitution if as a matter of administrative policy it is decided to levy tax on transactions of the nature mentioned in the preceding paragraphs. 6. Device by way of lea se of films has also been resulting in avoidance of sales tax. The main right in regard to a film relates to its exploit",

Article 32A barred the Supreme Court from considering the constitutional validity of any State law in proceedings for the enforcement of fundamental rights unless the constitutional validity of any Central law was also in issue in such proceedings. Article 131A gave to the Supreme Court exclusive jurisdiction to decide the constitutional validity of a Central law and thus deprived the High Courts of their jurisdiction in respect of the same. Article 144A pr ovided that the minimum number of Judges of the Supreme Court who shall sit for the purpose of determining the constitutional validity of any Central law or State law shall be seven and required a special majority of two -thirds for the invalidation of such law. Article 226A barred the High Courts from deciding the validity of any Central law and article 228A required that there should be a Bench of at least five Judges for determining the constitutional validity of any State law and prescribed a special majority for a judgment invalidating such a law. 2. It is considered that articles 32A, 131A and 228A cause, hardship to persons living in distant parts in India. Further, article 32A would lead to multiplicity of proceedings as cases relating to the validity of a State law which could be disposed of by the Supreme Court itself have to be heard first by the High Court. The minimum number of Judges in every case wherein the constitutional validity of a law is involved, however unsubstantial the challenge might be, results in valuable judicial time being lost in hearing and rejecting submissions that have no substance. The Supreme Court has, in M/s. Misrilal Jain vs. the State of Orissa and Others (AIR 1977 SC 1686) expressed the hope that article 144A would enga ge the prompt attention of Parliament and would be amended so as to leave to the court itself the duty to decide how large a Bench should decide any particular case. In fact, a number of cases have been held up in the Supreme Court and High Courts as a res ult of the aforementioned articles. 3. It is, therefore, proposed to omit articles 32A, 131A, 144A, 226A and 228A. It is also proposed to make special provisions to enable the Supreme Court and the High Courts to deal with pending cases in the same manner as if the said articles had been omitted with effect from the 1st February, 1977 (viz., the date on which those articles were brought into force). Necessary consequential amendments to articles 145, 228 and 366 are also proposed to be made. 4. Article 31D confers special power on Parliament to enact certain laws in respect of anti -national activities. It is considered that these powers of Parliament to make laws for dealing with anti -national activities and anti -national associations are of a sweeping natur e and are capable of abuse. It is, therefore, proposed to omit article 31D. 5. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objects. NEW DELHI; SHANTI BHUSHAN. The 12th December, 1977.

Recent decisions of the Supreme Court have given a very wide meaning to clauses (1) and (2) of artic le 31. Despite the difference in the wording of the two clauses, they are regarded as dealing with the same subject. The deprivation of property referred to in clause (1) is to be construed in the widest sense as including any curtailment of a right to pro perty. Even where it is caused by a purely regulatory provision of law and is not accompanied by an acquisition or taking possession of that or any other property right by the State, the law, in order to be valid according to these decisions, has to provid e for compensation under clause (2) of the article. It is considered necessary, therefore, to re -state more precisely the State's power of compulsory acquisition and requisitioning of private property and distinguish it from cases where the operation of re gulatory or prohibitory laws of the State results in \"deprivation of property\". This is sought to be done in clause 2 of the Bill. 3. It will be recalled that the zamindari abolition laws which came first in our programme of social welfare legislation wer e attacked by the interests affected mainly with reference to articles 14, 19 and 31, and that in order to put an end to the dilatory and wasteful litigation and place these laws above challenge in the courts, articles 31A and 31B and the Ninth Schedule were enacted by the Constitution (First Amendment) Act. Subsequent judicial decisions interpreting articles 14, 19 and 31 have raised serious difficulties in the way of the Union and the States putting through other and equally important social welfare legis lation on the desired lines, e.g., the following: - (i) While the abolition of zamindaris and the numerous intermediaries between the State and the tiller of the soil has been achieved for the most part, our next objectives in land reform are the fixing of limits to the extent of agricultural land that may be owned or occupied by any person, the disposal of any land held in excess of the prescribed maximum and the further modification of the rights of land owners and tenants in agricultural holdings. (ii) The proper planning of urban and rural areas require the beneficial utilisation of vacant and waste lands and the clearance of slum areas. (iii) In the interest of national economy the State should have full control over the mineral and oil resources of t he country, including in particular, the power to cancel or modify the terms and conditions of prospecting licenses, mining leases and similar agreements. This is also necessary in relation to public utility undertakings which supply power, light or water to the public under licenses granted by the State. (iv) It is often necessary to take over under State management for a temporary period a commercial or industrial undertaking or other property in the public interest or in order to secure the better manag ement of the undertaking or property. Laws providing for such temporary transference to State management should be permissible under the Constitution. (v) The reforms in company law now under contemplation, like the progressive elimination of the managing agency system, provision for the compulsory amalgamation of two or more companies in the national interest, the transfer of an undertaking from one company to another, etc., require to be placed above challenge. It is accordingly proposed in clause 3 of the Bill to extend the scope of article 31A so as to cover these categories of essential welfare legislation. 4. As a corollary to the proposed amendment of article 31A, it is propsed in clause 5 of the Bill to include in the Ninth Schedule to the Constit ution two more State Acts and four Central Acts which fall within the scope of sub -clauses (d) and (f) of clause (1) of the revised article 31A. The effect will be their complete, retrospective validation under the provisions of article 31B. 5. A recent j udgment of the Supreme Court in Saghir Ahmed v. the State of U.P. has raised the question whether an Act providing for a State monopoly in a particular trade or business conflicts with the freedom of trade and commerce guaranteed by article 301, but left t he question undecided. Clause (6) of article 19 was amended by the Constitution (First Amendment) Act in order to take such State monopolies out of the purview of sub -clause (g) of clause (1) of that article, but no corresponding provision was made in Part XIII of the Constitution with reference to the opening words of article 301. It apears from the judgment of the Supreme Court that notwithstanding the cle",

If the proposal for a legislation to amend the Representation of the People Act, 1951, containing, inter alia, provisions for the trial of election petitions by High Courts instead of the election tribunals, as at present, is accepted by Parliament, it would be necessary to make a minor amendment in clause (1) of article 324 of the Constitution for the purpose of deleting therefrom the words \",including the appointment of election tribunals for the decision of doubts and disputes arising out of or in connection with elections to Parliament and to the Legislatures of States\".

Article 81(1)(b) provides that the States shall be divided, grouped or formed into territorial constituencies and the numbe r of members to be allotted to each such constituency shall be so determined as to ensure that there shall be not less than one member for every 750,000 of the population and not more than one member for every 500,000 of the population. The present delimi tation of Parliamentary and Assembly constituencies is based on the estimates of population which have been given legal validity by an order of the President under article 387 of the Constitution. Article 81(3) of the Constitution, however, requires that u pon the completion of each census, the representation of the several territorial constituencies in the House of the People and the Legislative Assemblies of each State shall be re -adjusted by such authority, in such manner and with effect from such date as Parliament may by law determine. A Bill providing for the matters referred to in that article is being introduced in Parliament. Provision has been made in that Bill for the setting up of a Delimitation Commission for the purpose of effecting re -adjustmen t of the representation in the House of the People and in the State Legislative Assemblies on the basis of the population as ascertained at the census of 1951. There is a considerable difference between the population of the several States as estimated in the President's order and in the population as ascertained at the census of 1951. At present, seats have been allotted in the House of the People to Part A and Part B States on the basis of one member for every 7.2 lakhs of the estimated population giving a total of 470 members to these States. The census figures are higher in all cases, and in view of the overall limit of 500 members prescribed in article 81(1) (a), it is not possible to increase appreciably the total number of seats allotted to these Sta tes. It is accordingly necessary to reduce the representation from one member for every 7.2 lakhs of population to one member for every 7.5 lakhs of population as per 1951 census. As pointed out above, this figure 7.5 lakhs is the maximum permissible under article 81(1)(b) as it now stands; but even so, if the average population of a Parliamentary constituency in any State is to be 750,000 it is obvious that the population of a certain number of constituencies will exceed that figure. It is necessary, there fore, that article 81(1)(b) should be amended relaxing the limits prescribed in that article so as to avoid a constitutional irregularity in delimiting the constitutencies for the purpose of re -adjustment of representation in the House of the People as req uired under article 81(3) of the Constitution. This Bill accordingly seeks to amend article 81(1)(b) of the Constitution so as to replace the figures mentioned in that article by the figures 850,000 and 650,000 respectively. NEW DELHI; C.C.

The protection of this article is available only in respect of such tenures as were estates on th e 26th January, 1950, when the Constitution came into force. The expression \"estate\" has been defined differently in different States and, as a result of the transfer of land from one State to another on account of the reorganisation of States, the express ion has come to be defined differently in different parts of the same State. Moreover, many of the land reform enactments relate to lands which are not included in an estate. Several State Acts relating to land reform were struck down on the ground that th e provisions of those Acts were violative of articles 14, 19 and 31 of the Constitution and that the protection of article 31A was not available to them. It is, therefore, proposed to amend the definition of \"estate\" in article 31A of the Constitution by i ncluding therein, lands held under ryotwari settlement and also other lands in respect of which provisions are normally made in land reform enactments. It is further proposed to provide that where any law makes a provision for the acquisition by the State of any estate and where any land comprised therein is held by a person under his personal cultivation, it shall not be lawful for the State to acquire any such land as is within the ceiling limit applicable to him under any law for the time being in force or any building or structure standing thereon or appurtenant thereto, unless the law relating to the acquisition of such land, building or structure provides for payment of compensation at a rate not less than the market value thereof. 2. It is also propos ed to amend the Ninth Schedule by including therein certain State enactments relating to land reform in order to remove any uncertainty or doubt that may arise in regard to their validity. 3. The Bill seeks to achieve these objects. NEW DELHI; A. K. SEN. The 30th April, 1964. THE CONSTITUTION (SEVENTEENTH AMENDMENT) ACT, 1964 [20th June, 1964.] An Act further to amend the Constitution of India. BE it enacted by Parliament in the Fifteenth Year of the Republic of India as follows: - 1. Short title. -This Act m ay be called THE CONSTITUTION (Seventeenth Amendment) Act, 1964. 2.

This bill seeks to make these amendments and also some other amendments to certain provisions of the Constitution relating to the High Courts and High Court Judges, the executive power of the Union and the States, and a few entries in the legislative lists. The reasons for making the amendments are indicated below: - Clause 2. -The reorganisation scheme involves not only the establishment of new States and alterations in the area and boundaries of the existing States, but also the abolition of the three categories of States ( Part A, Part B and Part C States) and the classification of certain areas as Union territories. Article 1 has to be suitably amended for this purpose and the First Schedule completely revised. Clause 3. -The amendments proposed in article 80 are formal and consequential. The territorial changes and the formation of new states and Union territories as proposed in Part II of the States Reorganisation Bill, 1956, involve a complete revision of the Fourth Schdule to the Constitution by which the seats in the Co uncil of States are allocated to the existing States. The present allocation is made on the basis of the population of each State as ascertained at the census of 1941 and the number of seats allotted to each Part A and Part B State is according to the form ula, one seat per million for the first five millions and one seat for every additional two millions or part thereof exceeding one million. It is proposed to revise the allocation of seats on the basis of the latest census figures, but according to the sam e formula as before. Clause 4. -The abolition of Part C States as such and the establishment of Union territories make extensive amendment of articles 81 and 82 inevitable. The provision in article 81(1)(b) that \"the States shall be divided, grouped or for med into territorial constituencies\" will no longer be appropriate, since after reorganisation each of the States will be large enough to be divided into a number of constituencies and will not permit of being grouped together with other States for this pu rpose or being \"formed\" into a single territorial constituency. Clause (2) of article 81 and article 82 will require to be combined and revised in order to make suitable provision for Union territories. Instead of amending the articles piecemeal, it is pro posed to revise and simplify them. Incidentally, it is proposed in clause (1)(b) of the revised article 81 to fix a maximum for the total number of representatives that may be assigned to the Union territories by Parliament. Clause 5. -The proposed revisio n of the proviso to article 131 is consequential on the disappearance of Part B States as such. The two parts of the existing proviso have been combined. Clause 6. -Article 153 provides that there shall be a Governor for each State. Since it may be desirab le in certain circumstances to appoint a Governor for two or more States, it is proposed to add a proviso to this article to remove any possible technical bar to such an appointment. Clause 7. -Sub-clause (a) of clause (1) of article 168 provides for bi -cameral legislatures in certain States. It is proposed that, among the reorganised States, Punjab and Mysore should continue to have such a legislature, and that the enlarged Madhya Pradesh should also be provided with one. Since the constitution of a Legisl ative Council for Madhya Pradesh will necessarily take time, it is proposed to bring the relevant amendment of article 168(1)(a) into force from a future date by means of a public notification of the President. Clause 8. -This seeks to revise article 170 m ainly with a view to bringing it into line with articles 81 and 82 as revised by clause 4. Clause 9. -Under clause (1) of article 171, the maximum strength of the Legislative Council of a State is fixed at one -fourth of the strength of the Legislative Asse mbly of that State. Although in the larger States, like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, this maximum is adequate, it leads to difficulties in the case of the smaller States. It is, therefore, proposed to alter the maximum to one-third of the strength of the Legis lative Assembly. Clause 10. -Article 216 empowers the President to appoint to a High Court as many judges as he may from time to time deem it necessary and also to fix the maximum number of judges for each High Court by a separate order. The proviso is of little significance from the practical point of view, since the order fixing the maximum may be changed by the President whenever necessary. Th",

At present article 54 relating to the election of the President provides for an electoral college consisting of only the elected Members of Parliament as well as the Legislative Assemblies of the States (not Union territories). Similarly, article 55 providing for the manner of such election also speaks o f Legislative Assemblies of States. Accordingly, an Explanation is sought to be inserted in article 54 to provide that reference to \"State\" in articles 54 and 55 would include the National Capital Territory of Delhi and the Union territory of Pondicherry f or constituting the electoral college for election of the President. This would enable the elected members of the Legislative Assembly created for the Union territory of Pondicherry under the provisions of article 239A and of the proposed Legislative Assem bly of the National Capital Territory of Delhi under article 239AA to be included in the electoral college. 2. THE CONSTITUTION (Seventy -fourth Amendment) Bill, 1991 which was enacted as THE CONSTITUTION (Sixty -ninth Amendment) Act, 1991 received assent of the President on 21st December, 1991. The said Bill as originally introduced in the Lok Sabha sought to incorporate in article 239AA a sub -clause (b) to clause (7). This proposed sub-clause was subsequently dropped since inclusion of the said sub-clause w ould have necessitated ratification of the Bill by the Legislatures of not less than one -half of the States and thereby delayed the early constitution of a Legislative Assembly for the Union territory of Delhi. The said sub -clause (clause 3 of the present Bill) is sought to be inserted in the present Constitution (Amendment) Bill with retrospective effect i.e. from 21st December, 1991. Ratification by States is also proposed to be obtained for the clause along with ratification for the other clause of the B ill which seeks to amend article 54. 3. The Bill seeks to give effect to the above proposals. NEW DELHI; K. VIJAYA BHASKARA REDDY. The 24th March, 1992.

As a result, Urban Local Bodies are not able to perform effectively as vibrant democratic units of self -government. 2. Having regard to these inadequacies, it is considered necessary that provisions relating to Urban Local Bodies are incorporated in the Constitution particularly for - (i) putting on a firmer footing the relationship between the State Government and the Urban Local Bodies with respect to - (a) the functions and taxation powers; and (b) arrangemen ts for revenue sharing; (ii) Ensuring regular conduct of elections; (iii) ensuring timely elections in the case of supersession; and (iv) providing adequate representation for the weaker sections like Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and women. 3.

If a Municipality is dissolved before expiration of its duration, elections to be held within a period of six mont hs of its dissolution; (g) devolution by the State Legislature of powers and responsibilities upon the Municipalities with respect to preparation of plans for economic development and social justice, and for the implementation of development schemes as may be required to enable them to function as institutions of self -government; (h) levy of taxes and duties by Municipalities, assigning of such taxes and duties to Municipalities by State Governments and for making grants -in-aid by the State to the Municipal ities as may be provided in the State law; (i) a Finance Commission to review the finances of the Municipalities and to recommend principles for - (1) determining the taxes which may be assigned to the Municipalities; (2) Sharing of taxes between the State and Municipalities; (3) grants -in-aid to the Municipalities from the Consolidated Fund of the State; (j) audit of accounts of the Municipal Corporations by the Comptroller and Auditor -General of India and laying of reports before the Legislature of the Sta te and the Municipal Corporation concerned; (k) making of law by a State Legislature with respect to elections to the Municipalities to be conducted under the superintendence, direction and control of the chief electoral officer of the State; (l) applicati on of the provisions of the Bill to any Union territory or part thereof with such modifications as may be specified by the President; (m) exempting Scheduled areas referred to in clause (1), and tribal areas referred to in clause (2), of article 244, from the application of the provisions of the Bill.

The Supreme Court in its judgment dated 16th November, 1992 in the case of Indra Sawhney and Others vs. Union of India and Others, however, observed that reservation of appointments or posts under article 16(4) of the Constitution is confined to initial appointment and cannot extent to reservation in the matt er of promotion. This ruling of the Supreme Court will adversely affect the interests of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. Since the representation of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes in services in the States have not reached the required level, it is necessary to continue the existing dispensation of providing reservation in promotion in the case of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. In view of the commitment of the Government to protect the interest of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, the Government have decided to continue the existing policy of reservation in promotion for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. To carry out this, it is necessary to amend article 16 of the Constitution by insert ing a new clause (4A) in the said article to provide for reservation in promotion for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. 2. The Bill seeks to achieve the aforesaid object. NEW DELHI; SITARAM KESRI. The 31st May, 1995.

The extent of reservation has been increased by the State Government from time to time, consistent with the needs of the majority of the people and it has now reached the level of 69 per cent. (18 per cent. Scheduled Castes, 1 per cent. Scheduled Tribes and 50 per cent. Other Backward Classes). 2. The Supreme Court delivered its judgment in Indira Sawhney and others Vs. Union of India and Others (AIR 1993 SC 477) on 16th November, 1992, holding that the total reservations under article 16(4) should not exceed 50 per cent. 3. The issue of admission to educational institutions for the academic year 1993 -94 came up before the High Court of Madras in a writ petition. The High Court of Madras held tha t the Tamil Nadu Government could continue its reservation policy as hitherto followed during that academic year and that the quantum of reservation should be brought down to 50 per cent. during the academic year 1994 -95. The Government of Tamil Nadu had f iled a Special Leave Petition against the High Court of Madras in order that the present reservation policy of the State Government should be reaffirmed so as to ensure to continue advancement of the Backward Classes. However, the Supreme Court of india pa ssed an interim order reiterating that the reservation should not exceed 50 per cent. in the matter of admission to educational institutions. 4. In the special Session of Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly held on 9th November, 1993, it had been unanimously r esolved to call upon the Central Government to take steps immediately to bring a suitable amendment to the Constitution of India as to enable the Government of Tamil Nadu to continue its policy of 69 per cent. reservation in Government Services and for adm ission in Educational Institutions as at present. An all parties meeting had also been held on 26th November, 1993 in Tamil Nadu urging that there should not be any doubt or delay in ensuring the continued implementation of 69 per cent. reservation for the welfare and advancement of the backward classes. 5. The Tamil Nadu Government enacted a legislation namely Tamil Nadu Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Reservation of Seats in Educational Institution and of appointments or posts in the Services under the State) Bill, 1993 and forwarded it to the Government of India for consideration of the President of India in terms of article 31 -C of the Constitution. 6. In view of the importance and sensitive nature of the matter, the Union Home M inister held meetings with the leaders of Political Parties on 13th July, 1994 to discuss the provisions of the Bill. The general consensus among the leaders was that the Bill should be assented to. Accordingly, the President gave his assent to the Bill on 19th July, 1994. 7. The Tamil Nadu Government accordingly notified the Tamil Nadu Backward Classes, Schedule Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Reservation of Seats in Educational Institutions and of appointment or posts in the Services under the State) Act, 19 93 as Act No. 45 of 1994 on 19th July, 1994. 8. The Tamil Nadu Government requested the Government of India on 22nd July, 1994 that the aforementioned Tamil Nadu Act 45 of 1994 be included in the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution of India for the reasons given below: - \"The said Act attracts article 31C of the Constitution, as falling within the purview of clauses (b) and (c) of article 39 and articles 38 and 46 of the Constitution -vide section 2 of the Act. The Act has been passed relying on the directive principles of State Policy enshrined in Part IV of the Constitution and in particular, articles 38, 39 (b) and (c) and 46 of the Constitution. As the Act is to give effect to the directive principles of State Policy contained, inter alia, in article 39(b) and (c), the said Act will get the protection of article 31C of the Constitution and therefore, cannot be challenged under articles 14 and 19 of the Constitution, with reference to which article 14, the reservation exceeding 50 per cent. has been struck down by the Supreme Court. Now it has been decided to address the Government of India for including the Act in the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution, so that the law cannot be challenged as violative of any of the fundamental rights contained in Part III of the Constitution including articles 15 and 16, and gets protection under article 31B of the Constitution.\" 9.

Article 40 of the Constitution which enshrines one of the Directive Principles of State Policy lays down that the State shall take steps to organise village panchayats and endow them with such powers and authority as may be necessary to enable them to function as units of self -government. In the light of the experience in the last forty years and in view of the short -comings which have been observed, it is considered that there is an imperative need to enshrine in the Consti tution certain basic and essential features of Panchayati Raj Institutions to impart certainty, continuity and strength to them. 3. Accordingly, it is proposed to add a new Part relating to Panchayats in the Constitution to provide for among other things, Gram Sabha in a village or group of villages; constitution of Panchayats at village and other level or levels; direct elections to all seats in Panchayats at the village and intermediate level, if any, and to the offices of Chairpersons of Panchayats at su ch levels; reservation of seats for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in proportion to their population for membership of Panchayats and office of Chairpersons in Panchayats at each level; reservation of not less than one -third of the seats for wom en; fixing tenure of 5 years for Panchayats and holding elections within a period of 6 months in the event of supersession of any Panchayat; disqualifications for membership of Panchayats; devolution by the State Legislature of powers and responsibilities upon the Panchayats with respect to the preparation of plans for economic developments and social justice and for the implementation of development schemes; sound finance of the Panchayats by securing authorisation from State Legislatures for grants -in-aid to the Panchayats from the Consolidated Fund of the State, as also assignment to, or appropriation by, the Panchayats of the revenues of designated taxes, duties, tolls and fees; setting up of a Finance Commission within one year of the proposed amendment and thereafter every 5 years to review the financial position of Panchayats; auditing of accounts of the Panchayats; powers of State Legislatures to make provisions with respect to elections to Panchayats under the superintendence, direction and control o f the chief electoral officer of the State; application of the provisions of the said Part to Union territories; excluding certain States and areas from the application of the provisions of the said Part; continuance of existing laws and Panchayats until o ne year from the commencement of the proposed amendment and barring interference by courts in electoral matters relating to Panchayats. 4.

The Schedule consists of list of laws enacted by various State Governments and Central Government which inter alia affect rights and interest in property including land. 2. In the past, whenever it was foun d that progressive legislation conceived in the interest of the public was imperilled by litigation, recourse was taken to the Ninth Schedule. Accordingly, several State enactments relating to land reforms and ceiling on agricultural land holdings have alr eady been included in the Ninth Schedule. Since the Government is committed to give importance to land reforms, it has been certain decided to include land reform laws in the Ninth Schedule so that they are not challenged before the Courts. The State Gover nments of Bihar, Karnataka, Kerala, Orissa, Rajasthan; Tamil Nadu and West Bengal have suggested the inclusion of some of their Acts relating to land reforms in the Ninth Schedule. 3. Since the amendment to Acts which are already placed in the Ninth Schedu le are not automatically immunised from legal challenge, a number of amending Acts along with a few principal Acts are also proposed to be included in the Ninth Schedule so as to ensure that implementation of these Acts is not adversely, affected by litiga tion. 4.

The proviso to that clause, however, enables the co ntinuance of the levy of such tax at a rate exceeding two hundred and fifty rupees per annum in any State, municipality, etc., if in the financial year immediately preceding the commencement of Constitution there was in force in that State, municipality, e tc., any such tax exceeding that rate. 2. Some of the State Governments have represented that this celling of two hundred and fifty rupees which was fixed in 1949, needs to be revised upwards taking into consideration the price rise and other factors. It i s also pointed out that the profession tax has, at present, become almost regressive because of the ceiling since even people with high salaries have to pay this tax at only the maximum amount of two hundred and fifty rupees per annum. The upward revision of profession tax will also help the State Governments in raising additional resources. 3. It is accordingly proposed to amend clause (2) of article 276 of the Constitution to increase the ceiling of profession tax from two hundred and fifty rupees per ann um to two thousand and five hundred rupees per annum.

It has been found that many of the countries have specified 18 years as the voting age. In our country some of the State Governments have adopted 18 years of age for elections to the local au thorities. The present -day youth are literate and enlightened and the lowering of the voting age would provide to the unrepresented youth of the country an opportunity to give vent to their feelings and help them become a part of the political process. The present -day youth are very much politically conscious. It is, therefore, proposed to reduce the voting age from 21 years to 18 years. 2. The Bill seeks to achieve the above object.

However, under clause (5) of the said article a resolution approving the continuance in force of a Proclamation issued under clause (1) of that article beyond a period of one year cannot be passed by either House of Parliament unless the two conditions r elating to a Proclamation of Emergency being in operation in the whole or any part of the State and the certificate by the Election Commission that the continuation of the Proclamation issued under clause (1) is necessary on account of difficulties in hold ing general elections to the Legislative Assembly of the State as specified in that clause are met. The three year period in the case of Proclamation issued on 11th May, 1987 with respect to the State of Punjab would be over on 10th May, 1990 and the said two conditions are also not fulfilled. The prevailing circumstances in the State do not hold out good prospects for free and peaceful elections to the State Legislative Assembly. The representatives of various political parties who attended the All-Party M eeting convened by the Governor of Punjab at Chandigarh recently were also of the view that congenial conditions should be created first before holding the elections to the State Legislative Assembly. Clauses (4) and (5) of article 356 of the Constitution are, therefore, proposed to be amended so as to facilitate the extension of the said Proclamation up to a total period of three years and six months in relation to the State of Punjab. 2.The Bill seeks to achieve the above objects.

As regards President's Proclamation issued on 11 -5-1987 under clause (1) of article 356 of the Constitution, this has been approved by both the Houses of Parliament in October, 1989. 4.

Their request was recently embodied in a formal Resolution adopted by the Varishta Panchayat on the 12th June, 1961. In deference to the desire and request of the people of Free Dadra and Nagar Haveli for integration of their territories with the Union of India, the Government of India have decided that these territories should form part of the Union of India. It is proposed to specify these areas expressly as the Union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli by amending the First Schedule to the Constitution. It is further proposed to amend clause (1) of article 240 of the Constitution to include therein the Union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli in order to enable the Presid ent to make regulations for the peace, progress and good government of the territory. The Bill seeks to give effect to these proposals. NEW DELHI. JAWAHARLAL NEHRU. Statement of Objects and Reason s appended to the Constitution (Tenth Amendment) Bill, 1956 (Bill No. 35 of 1956) which was enacted as THE CONSTITUTION (Sixth Amendment) Act, 1956 STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS While \"taxes on the sale or purchase of goods other than newspapers\" is an entry in the State List, article 286 of the Constitution subjects the States' power to impose such taxes to four restrictions, of which two are total and two are partial. Under clause (1) of the article, a State is debarred from imposing such a tax when the sale or purchase takes place outside the State or in the course of import into, or export from, the country. With regard to the first restriction, namely, the non -taxability of sales o utside the State, an explanation is given in the clause that \"a sale or purchase shall be deemed to have taken place in the State in which goods have actually been delivered as a direct result of such sale or purchase for the purpose of consumpti on in that State\". Then, under clause (2), a State is debarred from imposing the tax on inter -State sales except in so far as Parliament may otherwise provide. Lastly, under clause (3), Parliament is authorised to declare the goods which are essenti al to the life of the community, and when such a declaration has been made, any law made by a State legislature imposing a tax on the sale or purchase of those goods has to receive the President's assent in order to be effective. High judicial aut horities have found the interpretation of the article a difficult task and expressed divergent views as to the scope and effect, in particular, of the explanation in clause (1) and of clause (2). The majority view of the Supreme Court in the State of Bombay v. the United Motors (India) Ltd., (1953) S.C.R. 1069, was that sub-clause (a) and the explanation in clause (1) prohibited the taxation of a sale involving inter -State elements by all States except the State in which the goods are delivered for the purpose of consumption therein, and further more, that clause (2) did not affect the power of that State to tax the inter -State sale even though Parliament had not made a law removing the ban imposed by that clause. This resulted in dealers resident in one State being subjected to the sales tax jurisdiction and procedure of several other States with which they had dealings in the normal course of their business. Two-and-a-half years later, the second part of this decision was reversed by the Supreme Court in the Bengal Immunity Company Ltd. v. the State of Bihar. (1955) S.C.A. 1140 but here too the Court was not unanimous. In pursuance of clause (3) of the article, Parliament passed an Ac t in 1952 declaring a number of goods like foodstuffs of various kinds, cloth, raw cotton, cattle feeds, iron and steel, coal, etc., to be essential to the life of the community. Since this declaration could not affect pre -existing State laws im posing sales tax on these goods, the result was a wide disparity from State to States, not only in the range of exempted goods, but also in the rates applicable to them. The Taxation Enquiry Commission, after examining the problem with great care and throughness, have made certain recommendations which may be summarised as follows. In essence, sales tax must continue to be a State source of revenue and its levy and administration must substantially pertain to the State Governments. The s phere of power and responsibility of the State may, however, be said to end, and that of the Union to begin, when the sales tax of one State impinges, administratively on the dealers, and fiscally",

Article 81(1)(b) provides that the States shall be divided, grouped or formed into territorial constituenc ies and the number of members to be allotted to each such constituency shall be so determined as to ensure that there shall be not less than one member for every 750,000 of the population and not more than one member for every 500,000 of the population. The present delimitation of Parliamentary and Assembly constituencies is based on the estimates of population which have been given legal validity by an order of the President under article 387 of the Constitution. Article 81(3) of the Constitution, however , requires that upon the completion of each census, the representation of the several territorial constituencies in the House of the People and the Legislative Assemblies of each State shall be re -adjusted by such authority, in such manner and with effect from such date as Parliament may by law determine. A Bill providing for the matters referred to in that article is being introduced in Parliament. Provision has been made in that Bill for the setting up of a Delimitation Commission for the purpose of effec ting re -adjustment of the representation in the House of the People and in the State Legislative Assemblies on the basis of the population as ascertained at the census of 1951. There is a considerable difference between the population of the several State s as estimated in the President's order and in the population as ascertained at the census of 1951. At present, seats have been allotted in the House of the People to Part A and Part B States on the basis of one member for every 7.2 lakhs of the estimated population giving a total of 470 members to these States. The census figures are higher in all cases, and in view of the overall limit of 500 members prescribed in article 81(1) (a), it is not possible to increase appreciably the total number of seats allo tted to these States. It is accordingly necessary to reduce the representation from one member for every 7.2 lakhs of population to one member for every 7.5 lakhs of population as per 1951 census. As pointed out above, this figure 7.5 lakhs is the maximum permissible under article 81(1)(b) as it now stands; but even so, if the average population of a Parliamentary constituency in any State is to be 750,000 it is obvious that the population of a certain number of constituencies will exceed that figure. It is necessary, therefore, that article 81(1)(b) should be amended relaxing the limits prescribed in that article so as to avoid a constitutional irregularity in delimiting the constitutencies for the purpose of re -adjustment of representation in the House of the People as required under article 81(3) of the Constitution. This Bill accordingly seeks to amend article 81(1)(b) of the Constitution so as to replace the figures mentioned in that article by the figures 850,000 and 650,000 respectively. NEW DELHI; C. C.

At prese nt an appeal lies to the Supreme Court, inter alia, on a certificate given by a High Court that the amount or the value of the subject -matter of dispute is not less than twenty thousand rupees or that the judgment, decree or final order involves, directly or indirectly, some claim or question respecting property of the like amount. The valuation cannot be the rational yardstick for a right to appeal. An important question of law can arise even in suits of small value and the test of valuation results in cas es without merit going up to the Supreme Court. The Law Commission recommended that clauses (a) and (b) of article 133(1) of the Constitution should be omitted and that an appeal should lie to the Supreme Court only if the High Court certifies that the cas e involves a substantial question of law of general importance and that in the opinion of the High Court the said question needs to be decided by the Supreme Court. The amendment of the article accordingly would curtail the number of appeals which are file d in the Supreme Court merely on the valuation test being satisfied, without any merit in them.

Article 123 empowers the President to promulgate Ordinances when both the Houses of Parliament are not in session if he is satisfied that circumstance exist rendering it necessary to take immediate action. Corresponding powers have been conferred by the Constitution on the Governor under article 213. Si milar powers have been conferred on the Administrator under article 239B when the Legislature of a Union territory is not in session. On the plain language of articles 123, 213 and 239B there is no doubt that the satisfaction mentioned in those articles is subjective satisfaction and that it is not justiciable. There is no doubt that this was also the intention of the makers of the Constitution. However, litigation is pending involving the justificability of this issue and contentions are being raised that the issue is subject to judicial scrutiny. To place the matter beyond doubt, it is proposed to provide in the Constitution that the satisfaction of the President, Governor or Administrator shall be final and conclusive and shall not be questioned in any co urt on any ground. 3. Article 352 empowers the President to declare Emergency if he is satisfied that the security of India or any part of it is threatened by war, external aggression or internal disturbance. Article 356 empowers the President to assume to himself the functions of the Government of a State if the constitutional machinery in any State fails and the Government in the State cannot be carried on. Likewise article 360 empowers the President to declare Financial Emergency if he is satisfied that the financial stability of India is threatened. Here again, the issue regarding satisfaction is, on the face of the articles clearly not justiciable. However, as the validity of the Proclamation issued under article 352 has been challenged in several proce edings and as litigation of this nature involves waste of public time and money, it is proposed to amend these three articles so as to make the satisfaction of the President final and conclusive and not justiciable on any ground. 4. In addition to article 352, contentions have been raised in certain writ petitions that while the original Proclamation of Emergency is in operation no further Proclamation of Emergency could be made thereunder. In order to place the matter beyond doubt it is proposed to make it clear in article 352 that the President may issue different Proclamations on different grounds whether or not there is a Proclamation already in existence and in operation. 5. When a Proclamation of Emergency is in operation, the President is empowered un der article 359 of the Constitution to make an order suspending the right to move any court for the enforcement of such of the rights conferred by Part III as may be mentioned in that order. It was intended that the powers conferred by this article should be exercised during an emergency according to needs of the situation. On the other hand, article 358 renders the provisions of article 19 automatically inoperative while the Proclamation of Emergency is in operation, and the power to make any law or to tak e any executive action is not restricted by the provisions of that article. The intention underlying article 359 appears to be that when an order is made under clause (1) of that article in relation to any of the rights conferred by Part III and mentioned in the order, the order so made would have for all practical purposes the same effect in relation to those rights as article 358 has in relation to article 19. It is, therefore, proposed not to have any differences in language between article 358 and the l anguage in respect of those rights only which may be mentioned in the Presidential Order under clause (1) of article 359. 6.

As a result of the enactment of the North -Eastern Areas (Reorganisation) Act, 1971 (81 of 1971), the total number of seats in the Lok Sabha allotted to the States has increased to 506, six more than the permissible limit of 500 under article 81. The actual total number of elected members of the present Lok Sabha is 522 (489 from the fifteen major States, 17 from the six smaller States of Himanchal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Manipur, Meghalaya, Nagaland and Tripura each of which has a population of less than six millions and 16 from the nine Union territories). 2. Clause (2) of article 81 of the Constitution la ys down that for the purposes of sub -clause (a) of clause (1), there shall be allotted to each State a number of seats in the House of the People in such manner that the ratio between that number and the population of the State is, so far as practicable, t he same for all States and that each State shall be divided into territorial constituencies in such manner that the ratio between the population of each constituency and the number of seats allotted to it is, so far as practicable, the same throughout the State. Under clause (3) of article 81, the expression \"population\" means the population as ascertained in the last preceding census of which the relevant figures have been published. Article 82 enjoins that on the completion of each census, the allocation of seats in the House of the People to the State and the division of each State into territorial constituencies shall be readjusted by such authority and in such manner as Parliament may by law determine. In pursuance of article 82, Parliament had enacted the Delimitation Act, 1972 and the Delimitation Commission has been constituted to undertake the necessary task of the readjustment envisaged in article 82. It will be noticed that adherence to the principles laid down in clause (2) of article 81 by the De limitation Commission in undertaking readjustment as enjoined by article 82 on the basis of the 1971 -census figures may have the effect of affecting the number of seats allotted to the States in the House of the People. It is felt that it would be better to ensure that any readjustment and consequent allocation of seats does not adversely affect the existing number of seats allotted to each State in the House of the People and to achieve this purpose it would be necessary to increase the strength of the Lok Sabha suitably. 3. In order to ensure that there is no reduction in the existing representation in the House of the People in respect of any of the States, clause 2 of the Bill seeks to amend article 81 so as to increase the upper limit for representation of the States from 500 to 525. The opportunity is taken to decrease the limit for the Union territories from 25 to 20, as the existing representation for Union territories is only 16. Government also consider it necessary to make an amendment in clause (2 ) of article 81 to provide that the provisions of sub -clause (a) of clause (2) of article 81 shall not be applicable to any State so long as its population does not exceed six millions. This is to ensure that the existing representation in the Lok Sabha is maintained for the smaller States referred to in paragraph 1 above. 4. Article 330 of the Constitution relates to reservation of seats in the Lok Sabha for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The provisons of this article have, however, been made inapp licable to the State of Nagaland on the ground that it has a predominantly tribal population. According to the 1971 -census, 88.6 per cent. of Nagaland's population belong to the Scheduled Tribes. The corresponding figures for the State of Meghalaya and the Union territories of Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram are 80.5 per cent., 79.0 per cent. and 94.3 per cent. respectively. Government, therefore, consider that the provisions of article 330 should not apply also to the predominantly tribal units of Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram. Similarly, it is considered that as in the case of Nagaland, there need be no reservation of seats for Scheduled Tribes in the Legislative Assembly of the State of Meghalaya and the article 332 of the Constitution may be ame nded suitably. Clauses 3 and 4 of the Bill seek to achieve these objects. NEW DELHI; H. R. GOKHALE. The 18th April, 1973. THE CO",

The suggestions of the Chief Ministers' Conference were accepted by the Government of India and necessary guidelines were issued to the State Governments for the revision of ceiling laws. 2. It is proposed to amend the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution to include therein the revised ceiling laws which have so far been enacted in broad conformity with the aforesaid guidelines so that they may have the protection under article 31B of the Con stitution and any uncertainty or doubt that may arise in regard to the validity of those laws is removed. In addition, two Acts dealing with the abolition of intermediary tenures are also proposed to be included in the Ninth Schedule, namely, the Bihar Lan d Reforms (Amendment) Act, 1972 and the Gudalur Janmam Estates (Abolition and Conversion into Ryotwari) Act, 1969, so that they may also have the same protection. 3.

The same article provides that m atters relating to their election shall be regulated by a parliamentary law. So far as the Prime Minister and the Speaker are concerned, matters relating to their election are regulated by the provisions of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. Under this Act the High Court has jurisdiction to try an election petition presented against either of them. 2. The President, the Vice -President, the Prime Minister and the Speaker are holders of high offices. The President is not answerable to a court of law for anything done, while in office, in the exercise of his powers. A fortiori matters relating to his election should not be brought before a court of law but should be entrusted to a forum other than a court. The same reasoning applies equally to the incumbents of the offices of Vice -President, Prime Minister and Speaker. It is accordingly proposed to provide that disputes relating to the election of the President and Vice -President shall be determined by a forum as may be determined by a parliamentary law . Similar provision is proposed to be made in the case of the election to either House of Parliament or, as the case may be, to the House of the People of a person holding the office of Prime Minister or the Speaker. It is further proposed to render pendin g proceedings in respect of such election under the existing law null and void. The Bill also provides that the parliamentary law creating a new forum for trial of election matters relating to the incumbents of the high offices abovementioned shall not be called in question in any court. 3. Recourse was had in the past to the Ninth Schedule whenever it was found that progressive legislation conceived in the interests of the public was imperilled by litigation. It has become necessary to have recourse to thi s device once again now. Between 1971 and 1973 legislation was enacted for nationalising coking coal and coal mines for conservating these resources in the interests of steel industry. These enactments have been brought before courts on the ground that they are unconstitutional. So is the case of sick textile undertakings which were nationalised in 1974. To prevent smuggling of goods and diversion of foreign exchange which affected national economy Parliament enacted legislation which again has been challen ged in the Supreme Court and in High Courts. These and other important and special enactments which it is considered necessary should have the constitutional protection under article 31B, are proposed to be included in the Ninth Schedule. Certain State leg islations relating to land reform and ceiling on agricultural land holdings have already been included in the Ninth Schedule. Certain amendments made to these legislations also require protection of the provisions of article 31B. 4. The Bill seeks to give effect to the above objects. NEW DELHI; H. R. GOKHALE.

The provisions of clause (1) of article 371 of the Constitution were intended to give effect to certain features of these safeguards. The Public Employment (Requirement as to Residence) Act, 195 7, was enacted inter alia to provide for employment opportunities for residents of Telangana area. But in 1969, the Supreme Court held the relevant provision of the Act to be unconstitutional is so far as it related to the safeguards envisaged for the Tela ngana area. Owing to a variety of causes, the working of the safeguards gave rise to a certain amount of dissatisfaction sometimes in the Telangana area and sometimes in the other areas of the State. Measures were devised from time to time to resolve the p roblems. Recently several leaders of Andhra Pradesh made a concerted effort to analyse the factors which have been giving rise to the dissatisfaction and find enduring answers to the problems with a view to achieving fuller emotional integration of the peo ple of Andhra Pradesh. On the 21st September, 1973, they suggested certain measures (generally known as the Six -Point Formula) indicating a uniform approach for promoting accelerated development of the backward areas of the State so as to secure the balanc ed development of the State as a whole and for providing equitable opportunities to different areas of the State in this matter of education, employment and career prospects in public services. This formula has received wide support in Andhra Pradesh and h as been endorsed by the State Government. 2. This Bill has been brought forward to provide the necessary constitutional authority for giving effect to the Six -Point Formula in so far as it relates to the provision of equitable opportunities for people of d ifferent areas of the State in the matter of admission to educational institutions and public employment and constitution of an Administrative Tribunal with jurisdiction to deal with certain disputes and grievances relating to public services. The Bill als o seeks to empower Parliament to legislate for establishing a Central University in the State and contains provisions of an incidental and consequential nature including the provision for the validation of certain appointments made in the past. As the Six -Point Formula provides for the discontinuance of the Regional Committee constituted under clause (1) of article 371 of the Constitution, the Bill also provides for the repeal of that clause.

The Resolution declared that the Assembly had satisfied itself that these activities of the Chogyal not only violated the ob jectives of the Agreement of May 8, 1973, but also ran counter to the wishes of the people of Sikkim and impeded their democratic development and participation in the political and economic life of India. Accordingly the Assembly solemnly declared and reso lved that \"The institution of the Chogyal is hereby abolished and Sikkim shall henceforth be a constituent unit of India, enjoying a democratic and fully responsible Government\". 2. The Assembly also resolved that this Resolution be submitted to the people of Sikkim forthwith for their approval. A special opinion poll conducted by the Government of Sikkim on the 14th April, 1975 resulted in a total of 59,637 votes in favour and 1,496 votes against the Resolution out of a total electorate of approximately 97 ,000. 3. The result of this poll was communicated to the Government of India by the Chief Minister of Sikkim on the 15th April, 1975. The Chief Minister on behalf of the Council of Ministers strongly requested the Government of India to make an immediate r esponse and accept the above decision, taking, as has been requested in the Assembly Resolution of the 10th April, 1975, such measures as may be necessary and appropriate to implement the decision as early as possible. 4. The Chief Minister and other Minis ters of Sikkim also visited New Delhi on the 16th -17th April, 1975 and urged the Government of India to take immediate action in this behalf. 5. Accordingly, it is proposed to include Sikkim as a full -fledged State in the First Schedule to the Constitution and to allot to Sikkim one seat in the Council of States and one seat in the House of the People.

In another judgment, the Supreme Court had held that the power of posting of a district judge under article 233 does not include the power of transfer of such j udge from one station to another and that the power of transfer of a district judge is vested in the High Court under article 235 of the Constitution. As a result of these judgments, a serious situation has arisen because doubt has been thrown on the valid ity of the judgments, decrees, orders and sentences passed or made by these district judges and a number of writ petitions and other cases have already been filed challenging their validity. The functioning of the district courts in Uttar Pradesh has pract ically come to a standstill. It is, therefore, urgently necessary to validate the judgments, decrees, orders and sentences passed or made heretofore by all such district judges in those States and also to validate the appointment, posting, promotion and tr ansfer of such district judges barring those few who were not eligible for appointment under article 233. 2.

In the Bank Nationalizatio n case [1970, 3 S.C.R. 530), the Supreme Court has held that the Constitution guarantees right to compensation, that is, the equivalent in money of the property compulsorily acquired. Thus in effect the adequacy of compensation and the relevancy of the pri nciples laid down by the Legislature for determining the amount of compensation have virtuality become justiciable inasmuch as the Court can go into the question whether the amount paid to the owner of the property is what may be regarded reasonably as com pensation for loss of property. In the same case, the Court has also held that a law which seeks to acquire or requisition property for a public purpose should also satisfy the requirements of article 19 (1) (f). 2. The Bill seeks to surmount the difficult ies placed in the way of giving effect to the Directive Principles of State Policy by the aforesaid interpretation. The word \"compensation\" is sought to be omitted from article 31(2) and replaced by the word \"amount\". It is being clarified that the said am ount may be given otherwise than in cash. It is also proposed to provide that article 19(1)(f) shall not apply to any law relating to the acquisition or requisitioning of property for a public purpose. 3. The Bill further seeks to introduce a new article 3 1C which provides that if any law is passed to give effect to the Directive Principles contained in clauses (b) and (c) of article 39 and contains a declaration to that effect, such law shall not be deemed to be void on the ground that it takes away or abr idges any of the rights contained in article 14, 19 or 31 and shall not be questioned on the ground that it does not give effect to those principles. For this provision to apply in the case of laws made by State Legislatures, it is necessary that the relev ant Bill should be reserved for the consideration of the President and receive his assent.

The result of the judgment is that Parliament is considered to have no power to take away or curtail any of the fundamental rights guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution even if it b ecomes necessary to do so for giving effect to the Directive Principles of State Policy and for the attainment of the objectives set out in the Preamble to the Constitution.

Certain crucial provisions of the principal Act as amended were challenged in the High Court of Kerala and in the Supreme Court, creating a climate of uncertainty in the effective implementation of land reforms. Although the High Court of Kerala has g enerally upheld the scheme of land reforms envisaged in the principal Act as amended, a few vital provisions have been struck down by the High Court. Even in regard to the provisions upheld by the High Court, the affected parties had moved the Supreme Cour t in appeal. Some persons also moved the Supreme Court in original petitions challenging certain provisions of the Act. The Supreme Court in its judgments delivered on 26th and 28th April, 1972, have generally uphold the scheme of land reforms as envisaged in the principal Act as amended but agreed with the High Court invalidating certain crucial provisions. It is feared that this will have far-reaching adverse affects on the implementation of the programme of land reforms in the State and thousands of tena nts will be adversely affected by some of the provisions which have been either struck down or rendered ineffective. It is also apprehended that certain observations of the Supreme Court in the judgments might open the flood -gates of litigation much to the detriment of thousands of Kudikidappukars in the State who will not be able to defend themselves in protracted legal proceedings. Further, appeals have been preferred against the judgment of the Kerala High Court invalidating certain important provisions of the principal Act as amended [e.g. sections 4A (1)(a) and (b), 7, 7D(1) and 103] and they are pending in the Supreme Court. 2. It is, therefore, proposed to include the Kerala Land Reforms (Amendment) Act, 1969 and the Kerala Land Reforms (Amendment) Ac t, 1971 in the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution so that they may have the protection under article 31B and any uncertainty or doubt that may arise in regard to the validity of those Acts is removed. The Bill seeks to achieve this object. NEW DELHI; H. R. GOKHALE. The 24th May, 1972.

It is proposed to achieve this object by including the Union territory of Mizoram in article 239A of THE CONSTITUTION (clause 2). The Study Team appointed by the Administrative Reforms Commission on the Administration of Union Territories and NEFA has recommended that the Administrator of a Union territory with legislature may have the power to promulgate ordinances when the legislature is not in session. It is proposed to accept this recommendation and include a suitable provi sion in the Constitution conferring on such an Administrator the power to promulgate Ordinances (clause 3). Under paragraph 18(2) of the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution read with article 240 of the Constitution, the President is empowered to make Regula tions for the North -East Frontier Agency. It is proposed to continue these powers even after the Agency becomes the Union territory of Arunachal Pradesh under the reorganisation scheme. It is also proposed to have similar powers with respect to the Union territory of Mizoram (clause 4). When the legislature of a State is dissolved or its functioning is suspended by a proclamation under article 356 of the Constitution, the Parliament is empowered to confer legislative powers on the President in respect of th at State by passing a law under article 357(1). No such provision exists in the case of Union territories with legislatures, with the result that whenever the legislature of any Union territory is dissolved or its functioning is suspended by an order of th e President, all legislation relating to that Union territory has to be passed by the Parliament. It is proposed that in such circumstances the Regulation making power under article 240 should be available to the President (clause 4). Hill Areas of Manipur are Predominantly inhabited by members of Scheduled Tribes. To safeguard their interests special provisions were made in section 562 of the Government of Union Territories Act, 1963 for a Committee of the Legislative Assembly of the Union territory of Man ipur consisting of members from the Hill Areas. When the Union territory of Manipur becomes a State under the reorganisation scheme, the said section 52 will cease to be operative. It is proposed, as a part of the scheme of safeguards for the people of the Hill Areas, to continue this arrangement even after Manipur becomes a State. So, a specific provision is being made in the Constitution for the formation of such a Committee (clause 5). This Bill seeks to give effect to the above proposals. NEW DELHI; K. C. PANT.

Although the Scheduled C astes and Scheduled Tribes have made considerable progress in the last twenty years, the reasons which weighed with the Constituent Assembly in making provisions with regard to the aforesaid reservation of seats and nomination of members, have not cheapest to exist. It is, therefore, proposed to continue the reservation for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes and the representation of Anglo -Indians by nomination for a further period of ten years. 2. More than ninety per cent. of the population of the State of Nagaland, which came into being in 1963, in tribal. It would be anomalous to make revision for reservation for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in Legislatures in the States where they are in a majority. It is, therefore, proposed, as des ired by the Government of Nagaland, not to make any reservation for the Scheduled Tribes in Nagaland either in the House of the People or in the State Legislative Assembly. Articles 330 and 332 of the Constitution are being amended for this purpose. 3. Und er article 333 of the Constitution, the number of Anglo -Indians, who may be nominated to the State Legislative Assemblies, is left to the discretion of the Governor. It is now proposed to amend that article so as to provide that not more than one Anglo -Indian should be nominated by the Governor to any State Legislative Assembly. This amendment will not however affect representation of the Anglo -Indian community in the existing Legislative Assemblies until their dissolution. NEW DELHI; P. GOVINDA MENON.
