THE CONSTITUTION (FORTY -EIGHTH AMENDMENT) THE CONSTITUTION (FORTY -EIGHTH AMENDMENT) Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Constitution (Fiftieth Amendment) Bill, 1984 which was enacted as THE CONSTITUTION (Forty -eighth Amendment) Act, 1984 STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS The Proclamation issued by the President under article 356 of the Constitution on the 6th day of October, 1983 with respect to the State of Punjab cannot be continued in force for more than one year unless the special condi tions mentioned in clause (5) of article 356 of the Constitution are satisfied. Although the Legislative Assembly is in suspended animation and a popular government can be installed, having regard to the prevailing situation in the State, the continuance o f the Proclamation beyond 5th October, 1984 may be necessary. To facilitate the adoption of a resolution by the two Houses of Parliament approving the continuance in force of the Proclamation beyond 5th October, 1984, it is necessary to amend article 356 o f the Constitution. It is therefore proposed to amend clause (5) of article 356 so as to make the conditions mentioned therein inapplicable for the purposes of the continuance in force of the said Proclamation up to a period of two years from the date of i ts issue.
