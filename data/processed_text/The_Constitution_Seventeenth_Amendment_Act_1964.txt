THE CONSTITUTION (SE VENTEENTH AMENDMENT) ACT, 1964 THE CONSTITUTION (SEVENTEENTH AMENDMENT) ACT, 1964 Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Constitution (Nineteenth Amendment) Bill, 1964 which was enacted as THE CONSTITUTION (Seventeenth Amendment) Act, 1964 STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS Article 31A of the Constitution provides that a law in respect of the acquisition by the State of any estate or of any rights therein or the extinguishment or modification of any such rights shall not b e deemed to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with, or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by article 14, article 19 or article 31. The protection of this article is available only in respect of such tenures as were estates on th e 26th January, 1950, when the Constitution came into force. The expression "estate" has been defined differently in different States and, as a result of the transfer of land from one State to another on account of the reorganisation of States, the express ion has come to be defined differently in different parts of the same State. Moreover, many of the land reform enactments relate to lands which are not included in an estate. Several State Acts relating to land reform were struck down on the ground that th e provisions of those Acts were violative of articles 14, 19 and 31 of the Constitution and that the protection of article 31A was not available to them. It is, therefore, proposed to amend the definition of "estate" in article 31A of the Constitution by i ncluding therein, lands held under ryotwari settlement and also other lands in respect of which provisions are normally made in land reform enactments. It is further proposed to provide that where any law makes a provision for the acquisition by the State of any estate and where any land comprised therein is held by a person under his personal cultivation, it shall not be lawful for the State to acquire any such land as is within the ceiling limit applicable to him under any law for the time being in force or any building or structure standing thereon or appurtenant thereto, unless the law relating to the acquisition of such land, building or structure provides for payment of compensation at a rate not less than the market value thereof. 2. It is also propos ed to amend the Ninth Schedule by including therein certain State enactments relating to land reform in order to remove any uncertainty or doubt that may arise in regard to their validity. 3. The Bill seeks to achieve these objects. NEW DELHI; A. K. SEN. The 30th April, 1964.
