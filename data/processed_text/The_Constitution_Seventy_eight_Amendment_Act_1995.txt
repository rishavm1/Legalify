THE CONSTITUTION (SEVENTY -EIGHTH AMENDMENT) ACT, 1995 THE CONSTITUTION (SEVENTY -EIGHTH AMENDMENT) ACT, 1995 Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Constitution (Eighty -first Amendment) Bill, 1994 which was enacted as THE CONSTITUTION (Seventy -eighth Amendment) Act, 1995 STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS Article 31B of the Constitution confers on the enactments included in the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution immunity from legal challenge on the ground that they violate the fundamental right enshrined in Part III of the Constitution. The Schedule consists of list of laws enacted by various State Governments and Central Government which inter alia affect rights and interest in property including land. 2. In the past, whenever it was foun d that progressive legislation conceived in the interest of the public was imperilled by litigation, recourse was taken to the Ninth Schedule. Accordingly, several State enactments relating to land reforms and ceiling on agricultural land holdings have alr eady been included in the Ninth Schedule. Since the Government is committed to give importance to land reforms, it has been certain decided to include land reform laws in the Ninth Schedule so that they are not challenged before the Courts. The State Gover nments of Bihar, Karnataka, Kerala, Orissa, Rajasthan; Tamil Nadu and West Bengal have suggested the inclusion of some of their Acts relating to land reforms in the Ninth Schedule. 3. Since the amendment to Acts which are already placed in the Ninth Schedu le are not automatically immunised from legal challenge, a number of amending Acts along with a few principal Acts are also proposed to be included in the Ninth Schedule so as to ensure that implementation of these Acts is not adversely, affected by litiga tion. 4. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objects. NEW DELHI; RAMESHWAR THAKUR. The 22nd February, 1994.
